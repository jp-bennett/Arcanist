      "Value": "The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a dimensional crack that she can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as a swift action, allowing her to move up to 10 feet per arcanist level to any location she can see. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as normal."
